## Installation
### Building From Source
1. Download The Repo Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/t0a5ted/qutetodo.git
```
2. Install All Dependencies (WINDOWS)
```bash
cd qutetodo
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Done! Run `main.py` To Start **QuteTodo**!  (WINDOWS)
```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage
A default configuration file is provided at `config/config.ini`. Syntax of the configuration file is similar to that of Microsoft Windows INI files. 

QuteTodo will use the configuration profile specified under `[PROGRAM]`. If a profile other than `DEFAULT` is being used, any key-value pairs which are not specified in the profile will fallback to the respective key-value pair in `[DEFAULT]` .

Below are the available configuration keys and their usages.

| StartupWidth    | Set the width of the window at startup                                                                                                                                                    | StartupWidth = [INT]  e.g. StartupWidth = 300            |
| Opacity         | Set the opacity of the window (from 0 to 1)                                                                                                                                               | Opacity = [FLOAT]  e.g. Opacity = 0.7                    |

| WindowStayOnTop | If enabled, the window acts as an overlay over other applications to keep you focused. Fullscreen applications may disrupt this feature.                                                  | WindowStayOnTop = [BOOL]  e.g. WindowStayOnTop = no      |
